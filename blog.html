            <li><h3>The foundation of mechanical engineering</h3></li>
            <p>The foundation of mechanical engineering is a set of core principles that all mechanical engineers must understand. These principles include:

                Force and motion: Mechanical engineers use their understanding of force and motion to design machines that can move objects and perform work.
                Energy: Mechanical engineers also use their understanding of energy to design machines that convert one form of energy into another, such as heat into electricity or mechanical work into electrical power.
                Materials science: Mechanical engineers use their knowledge of materials science to select the right materials for a particular application. For example, they might use a strong and lightweight material for a car's body or a heat-resistant material for an oven.
                Thermodynamics: Thermodynamics is the study of heat and its relationship to work. Mechanical engineers use thermodynamics to design machines that efficiently convert heat into work or work into heat.
                Fluid mechanics: Fluid mechanics is the study of fluids, such as air and water. Mechanical engineers use fluid mechanics to design machines that move fluids, such as pumps and turbines.</p>
